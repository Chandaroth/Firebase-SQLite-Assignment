#Mini project From Date 31-03-2020
	#Dear all,
For the mini project, we have 2 groups as follows:
Group 1: HEAN CHANDAROTH, LOR PHETH,MENG SOKLEARP
Group 2: SAY RATTANA,SENG SENGHAY
You can choose one of these projects(but 2 grous must not choose the same project):
-App has Login/Register function, Firebase authentication, save your name to SQLite.After login/register successfully, navigate to a Drawer or Tab with some functions: insert/update/delete Fruits objects.
User can select images from your phone's images or cameras. Fruits data is saved in Firebase Database or Firebase Firestore. You can add more functions as you like
- Replace Fruits by Products, Books, Students,....to make separated projects. For example: group 1 makes project with Products, group 2 makes project with Fruits, etc,...
